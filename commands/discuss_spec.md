# Core Philosophy

The cost of asking one more question now is minutes. The cost of discovering a wrong assumption during implementation is hours of rework and back-and-forth. **This command exists to pay the cheap cost upfront so the expensive cost never happens.**

Your goal: produce a spec so complete and a plan so precise that a downstream agent can execute it end-to-end with zero clarification questions.

# Input Handling

This command accepts two input modes:

1. **File path**: If the argument is a file path (e.g., `my-feature.md`), read the spec file and proceed with discussion.
2. **Description**: If the argument is a text description (not a file path), or if no argument is given, treat it as a free-form feature description and start the discussion from scratch.

**How to distinguish**: Check if the argument is an existing file path. If yes → file mode. If no → description mode.

After reading the spec (file mode) or understanding the description (description mode), also read the repo's README, CLAUDE.md, directory structure, and other context to build a holistic understanding of the repository.

# Good Behaviors

## Discriminative Questioning — Use AskUserQuestion to Complete the Spec

Do not rush to conclusions. Your primary job is to **ask questions**.

Good behavior: after reading the spec, identify all ambiguous, missing, or potentially misleading parts, then use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to **ask the user round by round** rather than guessing and filling in yourself. Focus on 1-3 key questions per round to avoid overwhelming the user.

Directions for questioning include but are not limited to:
- **Boundary clarification**: "What is the input range for this feature? What edge cases need handling?"
- **Priority judgment**: "Among these requirements, which is the core? Which are nice-to-have?"
- **Hidden assumptions**: "Are you assuming condition X holds? What happens if it doesn't?"
- **User scenarios**: "Can you describe a typical usage scenario? Who uses this and when?"
- **Trade-off decisions**: "If A and B conflict, which do you prefer?"

Each round of questions should push the spec's clarity one step forward.

**Anti-pattern to avoid**: Asking vague, open-ended questions like "anything else?" — every question must target a specific gap that, if left unresolved, would cause implementation to stall or go wrong.

## Uncover Meta-Intent — Understand the Fundamental Purpose

Don't just look at what the spec literally says. Go one level up: **Why is the user building this repo? Where does this spec fit in their overall plan?**

Concrete approach:
1. **Infer repo purpose**: From the repo name, README, existing code structure, and commit history, deduce what core problem this repo aims to solve
2. **Locate spec's role**: Is this spec the repo's core functionality? A supporting tool? One piece of a larger goal?
3. **Verify with the user**: Present your inferred meta-intent to the user via `AskUserQuestion` for confirmation, e.g. "I believe the purpose of this repo is X, and this spec is meant to achieve the Y part — is that correct?"

The value of understanding meta-intent: **the same spec under different purposes may demand completely different implementation approaches.**

## Expand and Correct the Plan — Eliminate Future Interaction

This is where the upfront investment pays off. The plan must be refined to the point where **no further human input is needed during execution**.

After understanding the user's meta-intent, examine the existing plan in the spec (if any) and do the following:

1. **Check plan-to-intent alignment**: Can the current plan achieve the user's real intent in one pass? Are any steps missing?
2. **Fill in gaps**: If the plan only covers part of the picture, supplement the missing steps based on meta-intent so that executing the plan fully achieves the user's purpose
3. **Correct deviations**: If some steps diverge from the meta-intent (doing unnecessary work, or heading in the wrong direction), propose corrections
4. **Offer alternatives**: If you see a better path to the same goal, propose an alternative plan and explain why it's better

For each plan step, ask yourself: **"Could an agent get stuck here and need to ask the user?"** If yes, resolve that ambiguity now by asking the user during this discussion, not later during execution.

Key principle: **The plan's completeness goal is "achieve the user's intent in a single execution", not "do part of it and see".**

## Ground Engineering Details in Feasibility

Once the plan's direction is confirmed, the final step is turning the plan from "idea" into "executable engineering". Every detail left vague here becomes a blocking question during implementation.

Resolve these now:
- **Technical feasibility**: Does the tech stack support this? Are there known pitfalls?
- **Dependencies**: What preconditions are needed? Are external dependencies controllable?
- **Interface contracts**: How do modules communicate? What are the data formats?
- **Acceptance criteria**: How do we know it's done? What are the concrete test scenarios?
- **Failure modes**: What happens when things go wrong? What error handling is expected?

These engineering details should also be aligned with the user step by step via `AskUserQuestion`, not decided unilaterally.

## Final Output

After all discussion rounds are complete, ask the user how to proceed:

Use `AskUserQuestion` with these options:
- **Save as spec file** — Write the finalized spec to a markdown file
- **Start execution now** — Generate a plan and begin implementing immediately

### If saving as spec file:
Write the results to the spec file (original file in file mode, or a new file in description mode). The updated spec should be **self-contained** — anyone reading it should be able to implement without asking further questions.

Updated content must include:
- Complete requirements description after clarification
- Expanded/corrected plan with enough detail to execute without interruption
- Key engineering decisions and constraints
- Clear acceptance criteria

### If starting execution:
1. Synthesize all discussion results into a detailed implementation plan
2. Use `EnterPlanMode` to present the plan and get user approval
3. After approval, implement the plan directly

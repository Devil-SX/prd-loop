"""Conversion prompt template for spec-to-prd."""

CONVERSION_PROMPT = '''You are a PRD generator for an existing codebase.

## Task
Convert the following spec into a PRD (Product Requirements Document) JSON format.

## IMPORTANT: Analyze Project First
Before generating the PRD, you MUST:
1. Use Glob/Read tools to explore the current project structure
2. Read key configuration files (package.json, pyproject.toml, tsconfig.json, Cargo.toml, etc.)
3. Understand the existing code patterns, conventions, and architecture
4. Identify files that will need to be modified or extended

## Input Spec:
{spec_content}

## PRD JSON Structure
Generate a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
```json
{{
  "project": "[Project name from spec or '{project_name}']",
  "branchName": "ralph/[feature-name-kebab-case]",
  "description": "[Brief description from spec]",
  "userStories": [
    {{
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "[Short story title]",
      "description": "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]",
      "acceptanceCriteria": ["Criterion 1", "Criterion 2", "Typecheck passes"],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": "[Reference specific existing files to modify]"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

## Rules for PRD Generation:
1. **Analyze existing code patterns** - Follow the project's existing conventions, file organization, and coding style
2. **Consider dependencies** - Order stories by dependency (schema/types first, then core logic, then UI/API)
3. **Reference existing files** - In the notes field, mention specific files that will be modified or extended
4. **Incremental development** - Stories should build on existing codebase, not rewrite from scratch
5. **Small atomic stories** - Each story should be completable in one Claude session
6. **Quality criteria** - Always include appropriate quality checks (typecheck, lint, test) in acceptance criteria
7. **All stories start with passes: false**
8. **Priority numbers should be sequential (1, 2, 3, ...)**

## Context-Aware Guidelines:
- If Node.js project: Consider npm scripts, existing test framework, TypeScript config
- If Python project: Consider existing test framework, type hints, package structure
- If existing tests exist: Stories should include updating/adding tests
- Reference the actual file paths you discovered during exploration

## IMPORTANT: Save PRD to File
After your analysis, use the Write tool to save the PRD JSON to this exact file path:
  {prd_output_path}

The JSON must be valid and parseable. Do NOT wrap it in markdown code blocks.
